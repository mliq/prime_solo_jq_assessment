# Prime Solo jQuery Assessment

*Welcome to your solo assessment. There is a specific reason I did not call this a ‘test’. We want to get an idea of where you are at. This is an ‘open book’ challenge, but it is completely solo. Normally we encourage collaboration, but this is not one of those times. We want to know better how you are doing.* 

*If you have a hard time with this challenge, don’t stress. Take a deep breathe and break it all down. Your peers around you might finish early, don’t let that freak you out either. Take a look through your notes, there is literally nothing in this challenge that is ‘stretch’ or that we have not discussed in lecture. Take your time, focus on you, and try your best.*

Create a project that has:
An index.html file,
An app.js file,
A stylesheet.css file,
A minified version of jQuery version 1.x (note that you will need to include jQuery into your project. If you have a hard time with this, feel free to use a CDN version, but we would prefer to see a copy local to your files)

1. In your HTML, include a ‘generate’ button, that when clicked, will generate a new div container in the app.js. The new div should include some text that reads “Line #” and then a number specific to the number of time the generate button has been clicked. In addition to the text, you will need to include two buttons within the new div. One button will be entitled ‘Change Color’ and the other button will entitled “Remove”.

2. The Change Color button should change the background color of the div container relative to the Change Color button that was clicked. For the purpose of this challenge, you can add extra functionality that when clicked again, it can change the color back to the original, BUT THIS IS NOT REQUIRED. Focus on core functionality first. Extra stuff later if you have time.

    3. The Remove Button should remove the parent Div container of the button that was clicked, removing the entire div, which contains the text, and the two additional buttons (the Change Color and Remove buttons). 

Once you are complete, check in the code into your personal GitHub, entitling the Repo “prime_solo_jq_assessment”. Then, be respectful that some of your peers are still working and remain quiet. Feel free to exit the room once complete if you are feeling like you can no longer contain yourself. The goal is to not overwhelm those who are still working with your speed.

However much you finish, know that I am proud of how far you have come in a week and a half. You got this.
Now go break this challenge down.
